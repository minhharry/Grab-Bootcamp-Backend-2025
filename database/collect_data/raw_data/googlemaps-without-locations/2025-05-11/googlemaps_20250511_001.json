Perhaps I just didn't read the description, but I was surprised there were 2 patties. However, the burger itself wasn't my favorite. The patties were okay, a little juicy and a little seasoned. The flavor of the meat was a little off. In D7, Back's Burger was a little better. Otherwise, a few others in D1 & Thảo Điền are better, in my opinion.\n\nThe combo (40K/$1.55) only includes fries. Although they are standard fries, they did taste about as good as they could taste.\n\nThe lamb (tortilla) melt (180K/$7.10) on the other hand was very good. The meat was slow cooked and chewed easily. The flavor mixed with the red onions was good. I would have gotten two melts had I known my opinion of the burger.\n\nAs a bar, there is outdoor seating and perhaps second floor (if there's seating up there) is well lit, it was kind of dark.

You arrive by boat and enter the restaurant through another restaurant. All the tables and chairs are adorned with nice LED lights, enhancing the ambiance. We ordered one of the set menus. The salad was definitely the highlight of the meal. The soup was pretty good, but the two main courses left something to be desired. The pasta noodles were enjoyable, but the sauce was overly strong, and the shrimp was overcooked. We also had the duck, which had good flavor but was far too dry. The scallop was quite good—I really enjoyed its texture; it wasn’t soft but had a pleasant chewiness. The steak was decent with good flavor, though it was too chewy. The grits served with the steak were interesting, somewhat like a localized version of grits. The best part of the steak dish was the roasted garlic—it was some of the best I’ve ever had. Its consistency was perfect, and the flavor wasn’t overpowering; I could’ve eaten the whole bulb myself. For dessert, we had the cheesecake and molten lava cake. The molten lava cake was just okay and not very molten—it would’ve been much better with vanilla ice cream on the side. The so-called New York-style cheesecake was neither New York-style, nor cheesecake, nor even a cake. It was more like a cookie crumble topped with sweet cream and a layer of pistachios or nuts. The taste was decent, but if you’re expecting cheesecake, it’s nowhere close. It should be renamed to something else. We were also given a call server button to request service, but it didn’t work at all.

This place uses the same tricks: everything is pre-prepared, and they rely heavily on a single sauce. Ordering a garlic naan gets you a regular naan with garlic sprinkled on top, and a chili naan is just naan bread with cayenne pepper. It's infuriating.\n\nI came here to enjoy Indian food but left shaking my head. The chole bhature, my staple favorite, was barely edible. The bhatura bread crumbled into nothing at the slightest touch, and the mutton was equally disappointing.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is an embarrassment. I'm embarrassed to have dined here and that they can serve such food and charge money with a straight face.\n\nMost of their business appears to come from delivery, so this review might not reach many potential customers.

The steak at El Gaucho is often highlighted as a standout feature. The quality and flavor of the meat is premium, noting that the steaks are well-seasoned, cooked to perfection, and offer a true taste of Argentinian beef. Popular cuts like the ribeye and sirloin receive particular acclaim for their tenderness and rich taste. However, some customers feel that the steaks, while good, might not justify the high price point compared to other steakhouses. The ambiance of the restaurant is usually sophisticated and upscale, with a comfortable and stylish setting that’s suitable for both special occasions and business dinners. The decor is elegant, with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and able to offer good recommendations. That said, there have been occasional mentions of slower service during busy times or when the restaurant is fully booked. The menu offers a variety of steak cuts, along with classic sides and some Argentinian specialties. While the focus is clearly on the meat, the sides and appetizers are considered good but not exceptional. Some diners think that the side dishes could be more creative or varied to complement the high-quality steaks better. Pricing is on the higher side, reflecting the premium quality of the ingredients and the upscale dining environment. While many customers feel the price is justified by the quality of the steak and the overall experience, others feel it’s a bit steep for what’s offered. Overall, El Gaucho Argentinian Steakhouse delivers a strong steakhouse experience with high-quality meat, a refined atmosphere, and attentive service. While it might be a bit pricey, it’s a solid choice for those looking to enjoy a great steak in an elegant setting.", "photos": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90Dzqq1RPPPABs_BBmeORUPCVivffsHP3Zks4od8RbMOFf65NZqH4W2sgpQF3v-ocfU3Hve9AR0NzO9JlCFmHx8b22yNdOJE7o-DP61AuL_fQxTAKcD-eJn-3VAD4Wx5wNDkBv49_g=w240-h180-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DIKwi5lSrP87ZZEmsbGZ0irOtgg9C2WzJcMajv3HQXcy-efvK5zPLyU6GTl9xlvf2MVdGAKYurn-N-QfIyKB-Q6QRwOEYyta3VS4bSnPFkNzwgGTpw_8fdELINqu5qZ6D0_--0=w240-h180-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BHTixHNYznjP-vLORM0-9ErJTy7CmGvx_ulX1sO8RzZaAwZ0mp2X5hpfvq7UfWuPGYbwjiZs2xo208MxajN55vqeE3_oHZcxlX4ZSJtdsVUwrRa6-3H2CbXYc6B9_Dt03TFRwBVQ=w240-h180-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90C9_wONUntBtOaY2kNr-_flxRsCSZ6F4ZhWldYI60QAnbUIh7E1dnZlF8Mo4yer_6CgEnhQUXkUi1JTXA8c1PcL-dO1VFcrCJOkhO-9dT4FWkprjgXREJV6gBFG2iWAw3125Y2j=w240-h180-p"]}, {"review_author": "N “Minaoka” N", "review_date": "a month ago", "rating": "2 stars", "text": "Many staffs but hard to get their attention, need to better oversee the floor.
