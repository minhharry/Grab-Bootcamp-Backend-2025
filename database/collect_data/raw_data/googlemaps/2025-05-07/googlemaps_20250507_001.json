I liked it so much that I came back 2 other times, and brought a friend the second time.  My first experience at this place, I ordered the Beef Skewers with Rice Vermicelli and an order Fried Spring Rolls and Pickled Plum Juice.  These were all recommended by my waiter, and I gave everything a 10/10, and the portions were huge and I completely devoured it.  The second time I ordered the recommended Stir-Fried Beef Fillet with Beef Sauce and Vegetable and Salted Lemon Drink and didn't like it as much, as it didn't taste as good and the portion was a lot smaller.  The waiter also forgot the Spring rolls we ordered.  The place seems to have a lot of foreigners (which is often a red flag for me), and it does seem a bit commercial (it is a franchise), so I questioned its authenticity as Vietnamese cuisine.  However, despite all this, I still highly recommend this place as it's still my go-to when I want a full hearty and tasty meal that seems reasonably authentic.

It was a very big platter of seafood. First time having such big sea snails. Mussels were ok, not my favorite. The shrimp were grilled just right. The squid had strong lemongrass flavor which is fine for me but not for my friend. The oysters were raw. Tastes good with the dipping sauce.

Hidden down a charming alleyway near our hotel, Rau Oi is a revelation. Step into a lush, plant-filled garden oasis and prepare to be amazed. The flavors? Beyond exquisite. The menu, is brimming with innovation (that 'Ut Non' starter and vegan duck are pure magic!). And the prices, unbelievably reasonable for this quality and sophistication.
