My family and I have actually never had French food before, but we were feeling adventurous.\n\nWe had the mackerel as an appetizer and chose the a la carte duck breast for the entree, which was the best duck we had ever tasted. Chef Sakal explained to us how the ducks came from the Mekong Delta and how they were dry aged and roasted. The duck skin was crispy like Peking duck, but the meat was incredibly tender and juicy. It is a must-order dish. We also tried the escargot which was seasoned perfectly and very enjoyable with the garlic and sourdough bread. My boyfriend has a previous bad experience with escargot at another restaurant but the escargot at Le Corto completely changed his attitude towards the dish. Finally, we had crepes (which were lit on fire!) with coconut ice cream and a dessert box with delicious truffles and small pastries. I think it is so rare to find a restaurant that excels in both entrees and desserts, but this one did!\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was so cozy but also very elegant. As an American, I noticed that many French restaurants in the USA seem very pretentious and stuffy, so their cuisine is often inaccessible to many people. At Le Corto, the waitstaff and Chef Sakal treat their patrons like family while still providing a classy and high quality experience. This restaurant is truly a gem in Saigon and I would not hesitate to eat here with my family again.

The restaurant was packed on a Friday night, yet still managed to get the meals out in a timely manner.\n\nNote, they do tend to ask you to rate them (on the spot) by scanning a QR code on your phone for their restaurant, right after your meal when paying. So probably accounts for how many actual reviews they get, & positive ones. With people feeling a tad pressured to say something nice about the food ,or the service. Not something we generally like, but as said this time, the food & service did justify a positive review.", "photos": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJL5kJf0sn2xtt3Mkt-M-gzo7M0XHoEq1hCZZt5HtrUpXDY4iZKE-nFgKESDonmvoLa2iR1Oxv6H_CFclEt0sW_u1lHfknYVQDfYhFLHYqQbah4YAtq7I_NDlgyz8XxkIqMvvKWF7A=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKm2P2KXoe9zZa_xIAnz_Yvm5M874ZOqflAGy-g2EjQl8LgLozANkx2J2wuFOLLGd-8SyLk_xLmQW7HgyUaZTpp_7Q27DeMv445-0eRaoCD_MhywEptk3RMlDftP6MTkUXA-Sa4=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJITzDfV5MoXK_O69yVZEGiXp_BjR-nnIzDDxirj0ncksvW5X-f-3jPryoKCsoF-sMnJDhTnaFaIY6YQzIAeFtvsoSl4LdRWl_ZlXQWPCzhZpFT6TsJPcffQs8w4EkNz3zuwlzBD=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKhKq-mzSSdKT_RNHFPIEqCXRlf3F7-wF1W6lBnFWS50c2sw4qURzMYAy78-B2ZF7w8F5Lyr3DCA_FLdW0K5tOEBasgXWLLtrgoQKof2qZLznJzVQzjTyUKAw_2FnVJnjZv4Qw=w420-h315-p"]}, {"review_author": "Maria Theresa Antonio", "review_date": "2 weeks ago", "rating": "5 stars", "text": "I stumbled upon Hoang’s Kitchen and it turned out to be one of my favorite food spots in the city!

The flavors were bold, fresh, and perfectly balanced. The grilled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and paired with the quail eggs, it hit all the right notes.\n\nBear really went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience — from helping with the order to making great suggestions.

There are both indoor and outdoor seating options, so you can choose based on your preference.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and fresh, and the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. One of the highlights of Poke is that it’s a healthy restaurant. The portions are carefully measured and well-balanced, which makes you feel good about what you’re eating. Everything is served with attention to detail, from presentation to portion size.\n\nThe only downside I found was that they don’t serve ice with drinks, which is something I hope they’ll consider adding to the menu in the future.

Our server offered excellent recommendations, and the chosen glass paired flawlessly with both the bone marrow and the steak, creating a truly harmonious culinary experience.\n\nJust when you think the meal couldn't get any better, Quince surprises you with a delightful candy box treat at the end. It's a whimsical and playful touch that leaves a lasting positive impression.\n\nOverall, my experience at Quince was truly memorable.

Beautifully presented.\n- Price: Quite high compared to the general level.\nThe fine dining experience was quite good. The service was polite and attentive. The food took a bit long to come out, perhaps because the restaurant was quite crowded that day. And there were some customers celebrated the birthday anniversaries at the restaurant that day.", "photos": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJdBN0xIFjfUWGf5YxPoYiNkkXqxK-AMT-iAjoW8TUCTYQQfZa6N1mLDFbujxnSFDhPRMFSxfO9uTXvLZp2aT-A90dSDkWqQXrzwyGYpUA80EdF4xxKC14JAiVMFWN4OzO5uX3vDA=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKgWebI05Dk_Lzy312R3unA3H_3T8eaHZvcc17vuSARcMyzvlYWyJQwnymkD83FGt7ECZMGnrMFjjYrn1EBp_KpspMKxdlJ6aJmGy_ODwgyUat8Wr-_ug6b9cnx2JZdB11Glaw=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJLTVUJkJRxnyC-UU3KGW14X0rGVlMXRbppSN_OHiz4mMIp1j1w5HZIzEs1x3Z-jk8DVT25sv5uYuRcLOyuo-hli4FauE4VNi3rKWk3_-4Jb-B_kDMBki4Mroxmtrg3S-IB8vuj5GQ=w420-h315-p", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIx7Wu3Ex4x4dLr8N50uNQujC6ZV2QgwGfOW2EvSeo-7KuaryN6slvjaAfLn_HQPzqEDhjS303oUL147k4aqar8NzPvUF__yMyUqNeoD9uDzRYy7t2u45i_YR_St_1aRoj7qqUo=w420-h315-p"]}, {"review_author": "M.K.

The moment I took a bite of their foie gras parfait (first photo) was when I started dreaming about my next visits here. Every dish was exquisite -- no flavors are wasted, they're all meticulously curated. Healthy portion so come hungry. If there's only two of you I highly recommend getting the bar seat to complement your meal watching the chefs in the zone. A beautiful experience in Saigon -- the only down side was that I was too full to try more dishes.
