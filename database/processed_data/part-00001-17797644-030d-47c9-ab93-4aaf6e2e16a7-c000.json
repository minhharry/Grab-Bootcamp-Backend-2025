I have a peanut allergy, and he went above and beyond to ensure I had safe and equally delicious options, offering great suggestions and double-checking with the kitchen. It made such a difference to feel so accommodated and cared for.\n\nHighly recommend this place for both the food and the excellent service.

My first experience at this place, I ordered the Beef Skewers with Rice Vermicelli and an order Fried Spring Rolls and Pickled Plum Juice.  These were all recommended by my waiter, and I gave everything a 10/10, and the portions were huge and I completely devoured it.  The second time I ordered the recommended Stir-Fried Beef Fillet with Beef Sauce and Vegetable and Salted Lemon Drink and didn't like it as much, as it didn't taste as good and the portion was a lot smaller.  The waiter also forgot the Spring rolls we ordered.  The place seems to have a lot of foreigners (which is often a red flag for me), and it does seem a bit commercial (it is a franchise), so I questioned its authenticity as Vietnamese cuisine.

My family and I have actually never had French food before, but we were feeling adventurous.\n\nWe had the mackerel as an appetizer and chose the a la carte duck breast for the entree, which was the best duck we had ever tasted. Chef Sakal explained to us how the ducks came from the Mekong Delta and how they were dry aged and roasted. The duck skin was crispy like Peking duck, but the meat was incredibly tender and juicy. It is a must-order dish. We also tried the escargot which was seasoned perfectly and very enjoyable with the garlic and sourdough bread. My boyfriend has a previous bad experience with escargot at another restaurant but the escargot at Le Corto completely changed his attitude towards the dish. Finally, we had crepes (which were lit on fire!) with coconut ice cream and a dessert box with delicious truffles and small pastries. I think it is so rare to find a restaurant that excels in both entrees and desserts, but this one did!\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was so cozy but also very elegant. As an American, I noticed that many French restaurants in the USA seem very pretentious and stuffy, so their cuisine is often inaccessible to many people. At Le Corto, the waitstaff and Chef Sakal treat their patrons like family while still providing a classy and high quality experience. This restaurant is truly a gem in Saigon and I would not hesitate to eat here with my family again. I would eat at any restaurant of Chef Sakal's in Vietnam!","review_id":"c073bacb-30aa-4f2f-bc6f-147db4e14143"},{"review_author":"V","review_date":"2 days ago","user_rating":5.0,"user_review":"I had a very good time there enjoying French mixed Vietnamese cuisine.\nSome traditional and some with SEA elements.\nApparently the owner/chef had good relationships with several iconic Michelin chefs who had been to Le Corto as guest chefs.\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, food came at the right time, not too fast or slow, just one by one.\nHighly recommend foie gras and baked mango with coconut ice cream.","review_id":"6e64a8cc-b71f-4585-b421-6f33727a73d2"}],"images":[{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIb95dtx0gqefVDU9ub78mig2WzJMGbIC8HJ3erJtyEcKM8CfXXK1HPN4m69pfVlc-Lc-6DaNe92vDAeesgQr17ILhAB8JDOauGRvT32elGwm9lY29MervIJcS0YP9k7KgpTHQIQg=w420-h315-p","img_id":"3b3bf3da-bcdd-4e7e-b50c-d194fb1cabb1"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJneUlvwYfIa3OVVniDCKbeBHi6kN5AsxsPyjHzJnuKKW3ZwiXWBBbRs2sgi5EpasE1Xn87re3VNtybxiA3waf1DLUvgH7VowgvIMZ3OEgYnKH_eNHPq0RUCQ2fiObkl8wOaAm7=w420-h315-p","img_id":"999be6e4-fe33-40ab-a92a-09120ed7db2c"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIa8VPJvaWYvWN2-6AQPUo4BbfL2Y5haTO01QQT5RbrPn30ieVM7uU5hIVunI4Uah3AqHZQfaydNmnrl81fMMVF2g1PDjdLcBIVsxVTXbxuqG1ckQVEjE7Tg9R0xsvY-bfkz5jj7Q=w420-h315-p","img_id":"25ae4bb1-5212-4aa1-b8f9-fadd05bc8e81"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIoM48SiFnNyHjJAoqw3ztzEhigQg5DuwL3FCF2R8ov73pKIGIVVzQNg3YntOsVkTs9lxSJBGtpdH-qAZc9_7JSIJ8y-rvO_fgp27w7dbErCG_wmSofOvQ2RmO6zxy79H9CE7U=w420-h315-p","img_id":"58cce2ad-f43a-470f-83eb-bf19c39acd83"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJJONn4p3kiZsJZ1PhXxHeXBGCRd1NOa8B7N9DeiMPYLeHQtV2sG-y70xuRvxUK21ZPueFtF1Dxemxmvo8DqYr6zqrgPWXFmrvj3BbXd8J2EjxE5BeHxKzW3lb-QcWQVRQJRPch4w=w420-h315-p","img_id":"b9bc7f14-bb01-45c8-a84c-1938af4b049f"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKK_GIH1zzuoAMjJdQ8ULg4bDEfyp77E6hEMNy4ixG84FEzwQsFYKfmMetloil-xvkP9UFSFQdq8EKcTPy6mGAHjJu9rdGjDrIHOJxCmWu2Fio0nfdgO2UqcyvyzAdmt_gbhJQ=w420-h315-p","img_id":"508f86eb-9efb-40c1-9ce2-93aad0fef49c"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJWsxBxobrKoVQ6EZGhfttfn7iM-Or228hN3UUC5VAJEq3PVyWKGDrryXsmqeZhBBIZhCupUL9K3yM6e-7BIMpsdsX9bP_EFX15600IW-yaxqQ9goTcVbmBQ00GrDJk6HUEVz3s-g=w420-h315-p","img_id":"034e12ab-9129-488c-8cc8-546ce62ef352"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIX2cqyCdGMhq3bgaL4noDiN8pcwDbU3I4tqRrPovtOWTePGcqt7p6hiyh7xKDs8QH9Hyz7IOPl6uWoyA6taMTIGw9FGNqGPttzd0Y7xMoV9KIbXmJsNIkUUbx1AzLg37ozOd6S=w420-h315-p","img_id":"2f3a6ee5-770f-4e9c-bb0e-292288bd909d"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJyvk8I_1OJs5VaUgBFfRCLv-D_YGCdtiFDRSHJSLHumMSbK3J0qU-tyleSqhdisJmm1jm3CvVhR8ahg8FuvNi81BMQEo4jFuPcVKlKEZBDJZAMtmkszj2psUdQpH0Hz_KwvcA=w420-h315-p","img_id":"d74acdf7-9903-469c-9fbe-ba21921ca979"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJL1muuiUQZV87Zk36ZPYoJ3K_jq0yRvw-HubfZaL38WoSkMIIC1KCkjtUBjiwLWxB0OYizuY_39KnlEBnDxcXIvdlIOxOCjKMRxxDjUfAAzrdhRGMMDN9JVhs1GwjmEannibouM8Q=w420-h315-p","img_id":"f3ca23d6-607c-4227-8881-87f06dc41fcc"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJxto3HgnLU7c9j8aszVguOHJJ2kILi6lvnSYf5zH66Qqw5bGmchB2WMJqep-wAb7sjaLQm5iQqxrbQqB0i7utaWJJDyFVEaUUXzjt31twVjHKfGVv_JXu9_YJLw6SlRzaBap8=w420-h315-p","img_id":"0b68cd4a-1735-4a7b-ac3c-6a5269b5365c"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIh93aRg_pwoBECN50_3Yh9k2SGh8dmr1IcJZ5a3dD6Pn-dQc4_SZB0WJ04hLQSNK5Azd726YqSEDxGEx9gPJAg3VH6mZ9uEDaYGssMLqBwirlxtuoKsWFnVcaLyD5aXZ-ETdc8MQ=w420-h315-p","img_id":"080ed28b-1708-442a-b990-7e4fe2c945c7"}],"crawl_time":"2025-04-24T13:41:16.000Z"}

The prices were reasonable for a restaurant in the city center, and the staff was polite and friendly.","review_id":"cff68691-6a0e-4bc6-b5f7-9261ac7cc69c"}],"images":[{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJ2Azc4AhkbWHJDvg0laZw3VZ7J138L3G0Q88KH06jLgiBs_2mD6YG1OdOuDlsd6drTbREZIch7p6fW9PUHxiDqlyLXXe4PO_UV4bfcPXob0UV_gPym2g5Ogy3rAiHDpUF3MED1tw=w420-h315-p","img_id":"bb86d44a-cf30-4447-af79-e750dbee0dcb"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJZj3bWQWJVlyrwiTyA2tTsiTbbbH0-eorJT--Y1_dyWppT2P-taKXfpe7tH-3kR_-bZKrMthAXNBW_A1sF18P0n43mySpWzFn6R3Vs_GVliNNbBuwT6780PKgSJfGZG6BpMhc=w420-h315-p","img_id":"5cd1c316-5778-45c2-9551-65a4fe8ebbc0"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJL3EsZu7yCP8FibXmTYan4clMrOwj9rixO3hH_Mktd7BzIkWHybw8so6TiTJj68bdS8CLOEwOSg0OJygHGDNdohWd9QH_j6eRa6zZ88LOlhgWNXaQfkMgyUKwzWhzHcvQOoCVxnxw=w420-h315-p","img_id":"ff6a295e-7c1f-434f-b817-562e277a0597"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJL_WPlW4tgD5DQ5XKyUtu1v8cAdwc1Elstk-jtg3c21lPXN9PuCkWVTshckUAxzkxskFAbmHhtBLPcEeUdzaIgJbrFlrKhQnVIOV1sKtivAGDNQ8NYC9FnHU72FeT5O0mxRXxg=w420-h315-p","img_id":"2cde8336-abe9-4926-9a2b-e2294825b735"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIwl-eK5IMXv3m_3CUcYpsXU65AxeK0cgY77ro6NW34p6TWhDC_NicUV0UzX1ILMVHdEYO4laVdj0K_sw42DXH4Ej-CpPNjL7mtl25R_ZvdcExJoZPRd0vFjS5jayhM4ajUBoKC=w420-h315-p","img_id":"b88f8040-a4a8-4148-a6f9-76306a0b4474"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIwfJYESAaGxU79BroOrby0fWGTEYNdocvWpYXxYF7qHFO78pJxgULRCi0SvSBk8VZCcRw668Ehs0wt9o-mJVkqLxepa_NVjIEs8Z0mAxTNFK8juspV1oDwuVXg_GssiI-3Ecun=w420-h315-p","img_id":"0d28a38f-ddd3-4df8-ac0d-beab0e61b001"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJsFQqaAFGgqQcYJ3vgtQxFfCRisLflS9No57Fvbafhc43omtS48_mJeiYdHhk82Q4pyHJG1XugYc96lQXuscrG41ScOm1KDH7wyhVYcsvdpSSgB_Pq40_rhd5AnpG_08g__cPM=w420-h315-p","img_id":"9262d303-296c-495f-892a-a89ce787322b"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJ7fCzFiDivi3QIiZB17wx8Y_s6CXDLPBm-q6rTwKSr3Xs7n0Q0mezCDZ2HhCil4GSXMdgHxQYvSPo8-RuapeWdyCm1vkOQ7nW8uYgowYbc0XgFhlPHX-vIdwUvrcvRGq6DvsZJnw=w420-h315-p","img_id":"dcd2da21-f7c4-422d-b154-d1ff83b5972b"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJK4W0aWPxLl61jfaTcoseeVxnObFqG5hxrC6J3WlzciPVVanFyD48Wm0r8cf7B_MTvTvvpEwDkXYhsNjmbIoOjAG3pk3TxCPxCAjijhypDHaGr7CPx_HpuD7dIetE9_U-JlZqa2=w420-h315-p","img_id":"05aebe91-d912-4535-9af8-2bb09e0c38d7"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJK3iyGq2X2bIeH4MVeLgoNpziNW2yN4zdZl0C-PNznQH7B1-dXh4Q-o1briSmVsGtOQHFkaS8qMbbNhDPkZZhDgSHZZYNt52e-0r1YEDZhWFwVr2vbqxUczFEdRMyr-iH-eEmW5Ww=w420-h315-p","img_id":"a2bdd0f0-7d81-432b-b740-da632c3e6a59"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJGQD9H4e4fufVWJkf3Jw0DcNPclvxaEQD-HbemmS1lR1anUjC6JsT5zXWhE1SV9GAH9MWbn5HfZtIa3I-9nG550SYfn3W1eA_W0srn7t20N7ktW2gpnDBcwwhY7Syvm5QUHKJn=w420-h315-p","img_id":"f6c2b4ce-2cd3-411b-b767-85e878904673"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJI7kL9vNAq6aTtP4hqnlmKPcHPYHppdR7jpSXAZXHqLNVsu9RK5ZVRAeivHhE1251mjbRiRuU878J2Zv4XzewzD_p2s9BsdlMH5_NPvP--VkaNvmh0Ea3LjcRe1D00sNdShZ199pQ=w420-h315-p","img_id":"f8ef2529-b9a7-45dd-a158-9328bdc27b02"}],"crawl_time":"2025-04-24T13:45:41.000Z"}

The restaurant was packed on a Friday night, yet still managed to get the meals out in a timely manner.\n\nNote, they do tend to ask you to rate them (on the spot) by scanning a QR code on your phone for their restaurant, right after your meal when paying. So probably accounts for how many actual reviews they get, & positive ones. With people feeling a tad pressured to say something nice about the food ,or the service. Not something we generally like, but as said this time, the food & service did justify a positive review.","review_id":"32134fd1-4642-484d-a0a7-9d9ed81e1411"},{"review_author":"Maria Theresa Antonio","review_date":"2 weeks ago","user_rating":5.0,"user_review":"I stumbled upon Hoang’s Kitchen and it turned out to be one of my favorite food spots in the city!

The grilled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and paired with the quail eggs, it hit all the right notes.\n\nBear really went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience — from helping with the order to making great suggestions.

But the prices are reasonable for the Vietnam area as well. This place is recommended by my hotel and it wasn't disappointing. It was a little busy when I got there so the only drop back was I had a flag down the server to take my order and then flag down the server again at the end of my meal just to get my check and pay. They added a service charge and a tax to the menu so be prepared.

Instant noodles definitely have more flavour and so much cheaper and the noodle they used felt like one from instant udon packet also only a pinch of crab meat were in the soup that must be why it has no taste.\n\nFried spring rolls were just ok but with that price point you would expect way more as it was 95k for one small portion.\n\nPls save your money, I beg you go somewhere else I was also charged for 13% extra for their service.\n\nWe left feeling ripped off still hungry and sad.\n\n제발 여기 말고 다른곳가세여 ㅠㅠ 맹맛에 게살도 거의없고요 너무 돈아까워서 눈물나여","review_id":"fbf6eac2-1fdf-4bb1-b0ae-bab5bb476b19"},{"review_author":"Joe Lloyd","review_date":"a month ago","user_rating":3.0,"user_review":"The portion size was large and general quality and service was good.

The Vietnam spring rolls had what seem to be bits of bone which I thought was my teeth crunching up. After that I stopped eating. I also noticed staff try to entice you to leave a good review in exchange for a free gift (worth $1-$2), and they stand over you and watch what you write to make sure it’s only positive.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of an old apartment building, and even though you have to walk upstairs, the experience is definitely worth it. The space inside is beautifully designed, airy, and much more spacious compared to  Nguyen Hue st. There are both indoor and outdoor seating options, so you can choose based on your preference.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and fresh, and the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. One of the highlights of Poke is that it’s a healthy restaurant. The portions are carefully measured and well-balanced, which makes you feel good about what you’re eating. Everything is served with attention to detail, from presentation to portion size.\n\nThe only downside I found was that they don’t serve ice with drinks, which is something I hope they’ll consider adding to the menu in the future. Overall, I had a great experience at Poke Saigon and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious, healthy meal in a beautiful setting.

The service staff is very professional and is always present in the dining room to ensure the requests of guests.\nThe restaurant is suitable for groups of less than 20 people.","review_id":"a9099aa0-8762-4cfa-a30f-2cc1dfb4ba41"}],"images":[{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKRUHwZNyiEOza7Ek0Re8rHzCVIkQnEdwRETOFlk8k7mHYgRcburUVUP9O_5PMZqkCNiM5UR-N5YDb_tekw9z7qMY3eLNb_RatgIh4eWPhY5JGEuXwUn6OXwhOeLHS_7oUFaQ89=w420-h315-p","img_id":"c7cb732d-a924-4169-b2b3-91bf86f22302"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIdvUG6TTaemppBbqMRtotdN0XcYRy82KxVX2dHw5b-7q_ki1qshDt7dFAfKKQjk0LMism0jjgsFxdqNEFZ4oEgYX95nhqV1eu5jZGEY0kkQojcyeIk59pcGSPvvnFNr2lnPgHSmQ=w420-h315-p","img_id":"952bc693-0c6b-4ca1-b55b-e840eef6aac1"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJL_-P8xTvbZTbT1VfKr4scAnIpHw7nfef5oXLnqGMYLQZgczUcbtFhMr4BiN0f9T_u9JC62ZCsM3IlgywdvhEnhYzVtMh5uqwViNhTveD0jepTpoq0s78xodGTNjJ2bTxiu6mq6=w420-h315-p","img_id":"23470c7f-0870-4174-a0fc-9aae2554eeb6"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKYl-U6hhDdu8vuVagoj4wJcc0CaDVBIhrAGFiS7Y_rtXTUFTqT6tjUwXljwmerytru3tep8dCuYNSmrpHxBbNCm_PoGd-OxLaMRdNXhKNj9_g4J93_I1HrrN_ySYt2rywInY6s=w420-h315-p","img_id":"82759796-510a-4f56-ad7d-f9561d16c761"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKGDzLmM-PtSAdZ0dg04UgF8wKR6jhiZm5JPUGPWAVz_cIvXF1mf8egb6R-DBhiCGfkhJijdSeBh9U2IdugrIrj59el_v3BbCU9IX-zItc4Lnz7zt0rEypRRudJq2DlclMJ47N1=w420-h315-p","img_id":"0771ee34-c1a7-4d59-8a70-0457d7f0fcac"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJEdirJ9y-h5zKVdeqHQNlRCXv9S4IQXgK6bnf42V0VpN2ZxFRvPrJJ8PVTdIp4vQRbDTi6DsilTP9CKtX3VWXPpbvY5D94jmvNqpNj_pKgZ25EbZIMApIvTQ52pJ7OFfypxVAo=w420-h315-p","img_id":"0cf6bc2f-5a8e-49d0-8885-cb9498f37fb7"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIJcvj6wXdJuURc2afIDTy6Eap1r6ArZssXrQCGpEtUk7ylSG-F8-9D52dpcl-mWXaaWYhnMRB-AAiwmfmJCtkxbdiKpG3UfLRJjHoCq8aDeIAVlJTIVi3NmC3H4DTOUAhQkAU4=w420-h315-p","img_id":"d56cd879-f42e-4721-bb0b-d261deb91a2e"},{"img_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKmasCawYMQzbBDsnWjei6j-ZnWusN_2SEyCFIoLICTmikgENU1JWxZteojICaOB2o00GrCJUuRH-fa5lfFT2J-CB0i_-218-motSIpj2Im_YwOGDNGBLWd4UlZ2ggDfum_Rzlu0g=w420-h315-p","img_id":"02a818ce-6072-4896-9130-21909d478e6e"}],"crawl_time":"2025-04-24T14:12:29.000Z"}

The **beautiful decor** strikes a perfect balance between modern sophistication and warm inviting charm. But what truly sets Quince apart, beyond its aesthetic appeal, is the captivating open kitchen concept. It's a genuine pleasure to witness the culinary artistry unfold before your eyes, watching the chefs work with precision and passion, transforming fresh ingredients into exquisite dishes. This transparency adds a layer of entertainment and trust to the dining experience.\n\nAnd speaking of exquisite dishes, the food at Quince is nothing short of **exceptional**. Every plate is a testament to the quality of ingredients and the skill of the kitchen team. It's easy to see why they've earned a well-deserved Michelin mention.During my visit, the bone marrow stood out as an absolute highlight – rich, flavorful, and utterly decadent. Similarly, the steak was cooked to perfection, boasting a beautiful sear and tender, juicy interior.\n\nTo elevate the meal further, Quince boasts a  vast and thoughtfully curated wine selection. Our server offered excellent recommendations, and the chosen glass paired flawlessly with both the bone marrow and the steak, creating a truly harmonious culinary experience.\n\nJust when you think the meal couldn't get any better, Quince surprises you with a delightful candy box treat at the end. It's a whimsical and playful touch that leaves a lasting positive impression.\n\nOverall, my experience at Quince was truly memorable. The beautiful ambiance, the captivating open kitchen, the exceptional food and drinks, and the thoughtful finishing touches all contribute to a dining experience that is both sophisticated and thoroughly enjoyable. If you're looking for a special meal in Saigon, Quince is an absolute must-visit. I wholeheartedly recommend it and can certainly see why it has garnered such well-deserved recognition.","review_id":"12eeb8da-61b3-48db-9f94-01ae1c0a9ec1"},{"review_author":"Mi Sachi","review_date":"a week ago","user_rating":4.0,"user_review":"- Restaurant: Not too spacious.
